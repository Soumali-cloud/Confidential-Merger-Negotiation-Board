## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### What Is This Project?

A **zero-knowledge smart contract application** for M&A financial verification.

Companies submit their financial data, and the system proves they meet qualification criteria **without revealing the actual numbers**.

### What Can I Do With It?

- ✅ Run it locally for development
- ✅ Deploy it to a blockchain network  
- ✅ Submit company qualifications
- ✅ Verify companies meet criteria
- ✅ Maintain audit trail
- ✅ Keep financial data private

### Key Technologies

- **Compact** - ZK proof circuit language
- **Midnight Network** - Blockchain network
- **TypeScript** - Smart contract code
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - User interface
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime

### The Flow

```
User fills form with financial data
        ↓
Frontend validates locally
        ↓
Generates ZK proof (keeps data private)
        ↓
Submits proof to blockchain
        ↓
Smart contract verifies proof
        ↓
Stores company as qualified
        ↓
Public count updates
```

### Security

- Private financial data **never leaves your device**
- Only ZK proof is submitted to blockchain
- Blockchain verifies mathematical proof
- Anyone can verify (but can't see your data)
